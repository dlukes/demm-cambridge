Exploring medieval manuscripts
==============================

This is a proof-of-concept app geared towards leisure learners who would like
to explore the intricacies of medieval manuscripts. The main feature is a
guided tour through the manuscript, presenting content in bitesize pieces with
occasional interactive tasks, as opposed to static text, which is the usual
presentation medium of this material for non-specialists.

The app was developed as part of the Cambridge DEMM Hackathon 2018, so two
things are in order:

- a big thank you to the organizers for making this possible!
- a fair warning to anyone who might want to dig around the code: it's
  **really** messy :) There were two of us working on it at the same time,
  stamping on each other's feet, so ugly hacks and bad practices abound. If you
  want to take this project further, I think a rewrite is in order -- use this
  prototype more as a source of inspiration for what the UI can be.
